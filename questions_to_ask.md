# For SWE

- Do you interact with researchers ? (If yes, what are traits that you value during your interactions with them / anything that has frustrated you?)
- I have heard that at google "Code is difficult to write and easy to run" (given need to integrate with existing tools, formats, ...) , would you agree with this statement ?


# For Research Engineer

- Do you often feel you are doing work that you wouldn't have been able to do somewhere else ?
- What makes a good intern in your perspective ?
- Anything you miss about academia ?
- How open is the culture around research ? (How openly can you talk about what you are doing with other researchers/other googlers/external people ?)
