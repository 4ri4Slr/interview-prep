# Questions to ask

## For SWE

- Do you interact with researchers ? (If yes, what are traits that you value during your interactions with them / anything that has frustrated you?)
- I have heard that at google "Code is difficult to write and easy to run" (given need to integrate with existing tools, formats, ...) , would you agree with this statement ?


## For Research Engineer

- What makes a good intern in your perspective ?
- Anything you miss about academia ?
- How open is the culture around research ? (How openly can you talk about what you are doing with other researchers/other googlers/external people ?)

    - manually derive and reason about weighting

- How do you tackle challenges? Name a difficult challenge you faced while working on a project, how you overcame it, and what you learned.
> When to push and when quit. Moving away from action recognition after 3/4 months.
> Publish code
> Assess the threats to your project, make estimates of how long algorithms will take to train, convert in count of possibile iterations over month

- What are you excited about?
> Collaborations, more specifically, learning from experts !
