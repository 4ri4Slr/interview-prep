# Coding interview prep

Coming from a mathematics background with limited academic coding training,
I discovered that internships at companies that I was interested in relied on coding interviews for recruitement, including for research positions during my PhD.

Although I code a significant part of the day for my research, preparing for the coding interviews is an entirely different, and very specific exercise.

While preparing for coding interviews, I kept notes of useful (to me!): [resources](https://github.com/hassony2/interview-prep/blob/master/resources.md), comments and [code snippets](https://github.com/hassony2/interview-prep/blob/master/to-know.md).

I successfully passed the interviews for Google and Facebook internships 4 months appart, and I found myself giving advice to other PhD students about how to prepare for coding interviews.

A targetted search will show that there are a lot of great resources for preparing the coding interviews ! 
This is a **collection of resources** that I **subectively** found **useful**.

## How I prepared

For the Google interviews I had roughly the following preparation:
- 1/2 days of finding good resources
- ~5 weeks during which I practiced for ~1h-1h30 every morning and 3-5 hours per day on weekends

#### What I knew before starting

I did not start from zero: 

Before preparing for the Google interviews (2 years before) I had read a part of [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/), the whole introduction, and at several exercises (with solutions) per chapter.

This means I was already at least somewhat familiar with most basic data structures (lists, linked-lists, stacks, trees, ...).

#### Learn about data structures, algorithms

- Whenever I stumbled on concepts/algorithms (trees, dynamic programming, ...) I wasn't familiar with, I would google and read about it.
    - Typically I would end up on a [Geeks for Geeks page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/) which I would read
    - I would then rewrite the proposed algorithm, and check that it actually works (through LeetCode or custom test cases)
- For an overview of more complex algorithms I found the [videos by Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IAPZzGSbME&list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O) very pedagogical and clear
    - especially on [Djikstra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB4MIexjvY0&list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O&index=45), [QuickSort analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qOVVRIZzao&list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O&index=37), [Prims and Kruskals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlRH0eK-qQ&t=29s), [Disjoint Sets data structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU6udHRIkcc&list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O&index=17)

#### Practice interview questions

-  [Geeks for Geeks top 10 algorithms in interview questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/)
    - I cycled through questions for each chapter, to make sure I had a similar coverage of all the topics
-  [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
    - I payed for the Premium account, and sorted the questions by frequency for the company I was targetting
    - I did maybe ~30% easy, 60% medium, 10% hard questions, and would stop when the code would pass the tests
    - Given that for Google you are coding in a Google doc, I would read the question in LeetCode, then write the code in a GDoc, and then copy-paste the code in LeetCode to pass it through the tests
    - Leetcode also has a mock interview mode that is timed and provides a set of 2/3 questions which I found useful because it is closer to the real interview setting (you don't know in advance if the question is hard or not)
    - I would try to solve them in real-conditions, including often speaking to an imaginary interviewer aloud in front of my computer (talking and solving the problem at the same time required some practice)
-  I did not solve problems from [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) at this time, but I did go through my notes on the exercises I had solved previously to refresh my memory on these classical exercises
- I also liked the following list from the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/best-practice-questions) although I didn't follow their suggested exercise list
